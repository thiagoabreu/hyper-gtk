# HyperGtk

Just a simple and fun experiment for writing Gtk apps in Gjs with HyperScript (JSX) syntax.

Inspired by @developit's post [WTF is JSX](https://jasonformat.com/wtf-is-jsx/)

## Running

```
git clone https://github.com/thiagoabreu/hyper-gtk
npm install
npm start
```

## Doesn't work

Right now it DOES NOT work with class components (like React).

For some reason, arrow functions as components doesn't seem to work either.

## What does work, then?

Functions! The good and old es5 functions.
